# datasc
A Data Science and ML project for learning and having accessible code

Usage:
1. Install a code editor (I love VS Code!) and install Python 3.
2. Run the file from the command line, VS Code terminal or VS Code run button (open file in VS Code)
3. Program will look for missing packages and attempt to install using Pip 
4. You need data to analyse so get some excel, csv or txt file in the same location with your datasc.py file.
5. Run and choose an option

Feel free to modify and push yourown code, make this better.
